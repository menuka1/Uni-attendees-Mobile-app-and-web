### Code Styles ###

/*                          - Object / Function definition
//                          - Build in comments
#                           - Dev comments
{}                          - always use a new line to write either '{' or '}'
tab                         - always use preffered tabbing for the better visualization of the code


### Coding Rules ###

camelNotation               - Use camel notation instead of '-' for function declaration if the view file has it.
under_score                 - Use underscore if the view file expands into a folder
